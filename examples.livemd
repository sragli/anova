# ANOVA Test

```elixir
Mix.install([
  {:kino, "~> 0.7"},
  {:kino_vega_lite, "~> 0.1.13"},
  {:anova, "~> 0.4.0"}
])
```

## Preparing input

We have a series of measurements grouped by stimuli. We applied the same stimulus on the first group, the second group is the baseline:

```elixir
groups =
  [
    [12394, 8802, 11233, 9523, 10351, 10063, 8181, 9665, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  ]
```

## Analysis

Our hypothesis is that the stimulus cause measurable and significant effect. It follows that the null hypothesis is that there is no significant difference between the two groups.

We will test it using ANOVA, using the significance level (Î± - the probability that the null hypothesis is true) 0.05:

```elixir
anova_results = ANOVA.one_way(groups)

alpha = 0.05

TukeyHSD.test(anova_results, alpha)
```

As you have seen, we have disproved the null hypothesis, the difference is significant.
